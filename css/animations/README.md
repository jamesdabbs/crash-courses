# CSS Animations

## Editable Examples
For the duration of this course, we will use the online [CodePen Editor](http://codepen.io/pen) so that we can easily and quickly make and see changes to our web page without having to create any files!

The `Before` links below are what we will edit in class. The `After`
links are to act as a reference for after the class to the solutions.
